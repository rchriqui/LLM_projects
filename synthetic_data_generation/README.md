# 🎲 Synthetic Data Generation

## 📋 Description

This project focuses on **synthetic data generation** using advanced techniques and potentially language models. Synthetic data is essential for model training, testing, and preserving the confidentiality of real data.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Generate realistic synthetic data
- Create datasets for model training
- Preserve confidentiality of original data
- Facilitate testing and development

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment
- **Data generation libraries**: (to be completed based on notebook content)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
synthetic_data_generation/
└── synthetic_data_generator.ipynb    # Main notebook for data generation
```

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Install dependencies** (if a `requirements.txt` file exists):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
```bash
jupyter notebook synthetic_data_generator.ipynb
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Open the `synthetic_data_generator.ipynb` notebook
2. Execute cells in order
3. Configure generation parameters according to your needs
4. Generate and export synthetic data

## 📊 Features

- Structured data generation
- Control over distribution and characteristics
- Export to different formats
- Visualization of generated data

## 📝 Notes

- This project is independent from the `llm_code_benchmark` project
- Generated data can be used for various use cases
- Make sure to validate the quality of synthetic data before use

## 🤝 Contribution
